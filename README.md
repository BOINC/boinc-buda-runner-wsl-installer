# BOINC BUDA Runner WSL Installer

A Windows desktop installer that prepares your system to run BOINC BUDA Runner under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and installs or updates BUDA Runner for you.

The app is a WPF application targeting .NET Framework 4.8.

## What it does

The installer performs a sequence of checks and guided actions:

- Check installer update
  - Queries the latest GitHub release of this installer and informs you if a newer version exists.
  - Note: The installer does not self-update. If an update is available, please download it from the [Releases page](https://github.com/BOINC/boinc-buda-runner-wsl-installer/releases).
- Check Windows version
  - Verifies that your Windows version supports WSL2.
- Check Windows features
  - Ensures required Windows features (e.g., Virtual Machine Platform, WSL) are enabled.
  - Attempts to enable missing features. A restart may be required.
- Check WSL installation and configuration
  - Installs WSL if missing, or fixes common configuration issues.
  - Sets the default WSL version to 2.
- Check BOINC process
  - Detects if a BOINC client is currently running. If running, you�ll be asked to stop it before continuing.
- Check BUDA Runner
  - Installs or updates BUDA Runner to the latest version, or confirms that it�s up to date.

## Requirements

- Supported OS:
  - Windows 11 (recommended)
  - Windows 10 version 2004 (build 19041) or newer (WSL2 support required)
